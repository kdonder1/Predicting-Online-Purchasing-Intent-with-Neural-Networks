# Predicting-Online-Purchasing-Intent-with-Neural-Networks

This project builds and evaluates a multilayer perceptron to predict whether an online user session results in a purchase. Using behavioural and administrative features, the model is analyzed through ablation studies and precision–recall metrics to understand feature importance, class imbalance, and real-world performance tradeoffs.

This was a final project for MATH 457 - Statistical Learning. This was completed in collaboration with two other students.

The repository includes our final paper, outlining our literature review and methodology for this code.
